# Project: CheatSheet
<em>Project for Codecademy</em>

This is a project made for the <strong>Full-Stack Engineer</strong> program at Codecademy.

I needed to make a <strong>CheatSheet</strong> containing information about <strong>HTML Tags & Attributes or CSS</strong>.

I chose to make a cheatsheet for <strong>Table Tags & Common CSS properties</strong>.
I used my current knowledge of HTML&CSS to make a static website containing tables with information.
